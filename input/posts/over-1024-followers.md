I hope you're as hyped as I am that we've exceeded 1024 followers on the [DevChatter Twitch Account](https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter). It took us about 4 months to reach that goal from 0, but here we are. As we've managed this achievement, I'm starting the planning phase for our upcoming event. At this point, based on my schedule, I'll be planning to have the stream at the end of July. I'll make sure that it's well-published and available as soon as the date is set.

We're a programming stream, so we didn't celebrate 500 followers and 1000 followers like the gaming channels often do. We celebrated 512 followers a while ago and will now be celebrating reaching 1024 followers! Everything's better with binary.

## 1024 Follower Special Event Planning

I haven't decided yet what we'll be doing, but the likely events will involve more than a few guests. Options include:

- Panel Discussion with Experts
- Programming Competition
- Programming Race
- 8-hour Workshop

## Next Goal

It will still be a little while, but our next goal is 2048 Followers. Your guess is as good as mine for when we'll achieve that goal, but I am hoping that we can reach it faster than we got from 0 to 1024. My fingers are corssed. Are yours?
