This post is scheduled for publication on the day we first put our site on Azure as a static site (preview). We're doing a stream on June 5, 2018 with [Maxime Rouiller](https://twitter.com/MaximRouiller) where he will be showing us the static site preview in Azure and talking with us about thow this serverless hosting approach can be effective for doing automatically-generated static sites.

We're initially building this site using [wyam](https://wyam.io), and had a stream on Saturday, June 2, 2018 with [Dave Glick](https://twitter.com/daveaglick). On that episode of DevChatter, Dave worked with us to set up our initial site, talking through the use of WYAM and showing us some of its power through customizing the pipeline using by our site's "blog" recipe.

The next steps for the site are getting its domain settings configured so that [DevChatter.com](//devchatter.com) works correctly, and once that's done, we'll need to get the site's styling improved. Wait, you mean that an out-of-the-box theme isn't enough? Nope.
